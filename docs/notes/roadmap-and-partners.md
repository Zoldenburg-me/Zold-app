# Roadmap and payout partners

*Moved verbatim out of CLAUDE.md (Sep 2026). CLAUDE.md carries a condensed
version; this is the original with the per-partner detail.*

## Roadmap (agreed priority)
0. Payout partners secured (July 2026): **dLocal** (crypto product:
   stablecoin-funded payouts, 60+ markets — UPI/India, M-Pesa/Kenya, PIX/
   LATAM; docs.dlocal.com has a public sandbox) and **Yellow Card** (Africa,
   ~20 markets, settles natively in USDC — no prefunding). Build PayoutRail
   adapters for both; Kenya gets two live options (route to best price).
   Pin down per-corridor: settlement currency, prefunding terms, fees/FX,
   recipient KYC ownership, speeds/caps.
1. Iron (iron.xyz, MoonPay) sandbox → USD/GBP funding adapter. Access is
   request-based; user must request it. EUR stays direct-Monerium.
2. Mony partnership (UPI One World app; replied to user's tweet):
   stablecoin top-up of Mony wallets via our SEPA exit → their Banking
   Circle account. Their inbound is manual screenshot reconciliation —
   pitch = we become their reconciliation/API layer. Bebop RFQ for
   crypto→EURe conversion. Constraints learned: ~2% top-up fee, €25 exit
   fee, low-KYC tier caps; SEPA Instant is EU-mandated since Oct 2025 so
   the "24h" is their internal crediting, not the rail.
3. Public-chain deployment — DONE on **Base Sepolia (84532)**, not Polygon.
   The Polygon case was "EURe is native there"; Monerium's production /tokens
   shows EURe on SIX chains — ethereum 1, gnosis 100, polygon 137, base 8453,
   arbitrum 42161, linea 59144 — so that argument no longer selects a chain on
   its own. Choose on liquidity and gas instead: LI.FI quoted best on Base
   (1.1506 vs 1.1493 Gnosis, 1.1491 Polygon), CoW's EURe depth is on Gnosis,
   and Bebop's Monerium market-maker feed is on Ethereum. Nothing is pinned:
   TRANSF_CHAIN_ID selects the chain and deployments.json is keyed by it.
   Monerium sandbox chain names verified: `amoy`, `basesepolia`.
4. Passkey-as-Safe-owner (true non-custodial; today passkey is auth only).
5. Card rail — **Immersve** (immersve.com, docs.immersve.com). Mastercard
   PRINCIPAL MEMBER, so they are the issuer rather than a reseller (contrast
   Gnosis Pay, which routes through Monavate). Three funding protocols:
   - *Approval-based* (Universal EVM): cardholder spends straight from their
     own wallet via a standard ERC-20 approval — no deposit, no migration.
   - *Flexi deposit*: a dedicated cardholder-scoped contract, balance readable
     on-chain, PERMISSIONLESS withdrawals (the user can always exit).
   - *Universal deposit*: one shared partner-scoped contract, cheaper gas.
   Authorisation flow: Mastercard sends the auth, Immersve reads the chain in
   real time, and on sufficient funds pulls the token, converts to fiat via
   Circle and settles with Mastercard.
   Chains: Algorand, Arbitrum, **Base**, BNB, Ethereum, **Polygon**, Sei —
   both chains we care about are covered.
   THE CATCH: **USDC/USDT only. No EURe.** Our vault holds EURe, so a card
   cannot spend the balance directly. Either the user keeps a USDC sleeve, or
   we convert on demand — which the cash rail already does (FxSwapper /
   JIT RFQ), so the machinery exists. Note this puts EUR/USD FX between a
   user's balance and their card spend; on the RECIPIENT side that question
   disappears, since they can be paid in USDC and spend it.
   Also: Immersve runs its own KYC ("Immersve Conducted KYC", recommended for
   non-custodial), so it is a second identity relationship alongside
   Monerium's, not a reuse of it.
   Best fit is the receiving end — a recipient who can spend beats one
   collecting cash at a counter. Unanswered: issuer of record per region
   (their site says "regulatory licenses" without naming entities, and our
   regulator page names entities precisely), and per-region availability.
Parked deliberately: NEAR Intents (future multi-chain deposits), Metastable
(EURe↔EURC later), Flexa/AMP (no — wrong market, card program beats it).
