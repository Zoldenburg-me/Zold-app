/**
 * Runs a command with dotenv lines read from file descriptor 3 merged into its
 * environment. secrets.sh decrypts first, refuses on any failure, and only
 * then pipes the plaintext into fd 3, so the values exist in memory and in the
 * child's environment, never in a file.
 *
 * A variable already set in the environment wins, as with process.loadEnvFile.
 * An empty or unreadable fd 3 refuses to start the command rather than
 * starting it without its secrets. The command's exit code, or the signal that
 * killed it, is this process's too.
